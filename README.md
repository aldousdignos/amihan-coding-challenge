# amihan-coding-challenge

## NOTES:

I solved the problems and coded in Visual Studio Code before realizing that I would be uploading to github.
So the creation of the repository and the uploading of the files were only done after I was done with the 
coding challenges. Therefore, the files do not contain a version history (though I still tried to put clear
and concise commit messages). Regardless, I am familiar with using Jira, Azure DevOps, and Git used for 
version control.

## Running Code

As for running the code. They can be run locally by downloading the repository and installing python on the system.
then opening a terminal in the root directory of the repository and executing "python problem_set_x/file_name_here.py"

(There are no user inputs and for testing must be changed directly in the code)
